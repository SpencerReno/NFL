## NFL Players From College
This Graph shows which colleges are the best at producing NFL-caliber players. Alabama being one of the best colleges for a long time winning multiple championships in the last decade is the best at producing NFL-caliber players. The most obvious take way from this graph is that all these colleges are D1 colleges. With that being said it's proven that if you are going to a D1 college you have a more likely chance to get noticed and have a shot at the NFL.
